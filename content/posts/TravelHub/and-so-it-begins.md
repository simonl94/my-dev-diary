## Introduction 💡
It wasn't until my wife and I were organising our honeymoon trip to Indonesia that there was quite a bit of unexpected planning required. This wasn't my first time overseas, but it was definitely in a unfamiliar country. For example, something like Uber (and Uber Eats) isn't used in Indonesia, but there are apps like Grab and Gojek that accomplish the same thing. I had to find and figure out e-sims for phone data since my carrier in Australia wasn't very cost-effective for roaming. There was also the matter of finding a good travel insurance provider, and the list goes on. I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a one-stop-shop for all of this information? 🤔" and "what if I could create a travel plan or itinerary and consolidate all my ideas into one central place?". That's what I hope to achieve with this travel hub side project.

Now, I know this isn't a an original idea per-say, but I think it's a good idea to have a project that I can work on in my spare time. I think I have some good ideas on how to make this project a bit more unique from others, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

## The Plan 📝
The idea here is to create a full stack application that uses some new technologies that I haven't used before, or at least, unfamiliar with and want to get better at. We know the idea is to have a platform users can engage with to create and manage their travel plans, but let's break down each part of the project into smaller tasks:
